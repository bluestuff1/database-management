### How do you think the DBMS would execute this query?
```mysql
EXPLAIN EXTENDED
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders;
```

Only the index gets checked instead of the whole tuple. 

### Is this different from what you expected? 

Yes, it is very different to what I expected. I thought it would read through each tuple.

### Can you reason why this strategy was chosen?

It is faster to check just the index rather than checking each tuple fully.
